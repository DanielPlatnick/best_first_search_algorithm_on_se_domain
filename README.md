# To Do:

All due by Nov 26th
- [x] Confirm Heuristics work - tweak random experiments and confirm somehow - Samad - Nov 23
- [x] Set up Heuristic Experiments - evaluate node expansions, cost for each heuristic - Samad - Nov 24
- [x] Try WA* with Best Heuristic - Samad - Nov 25
- [x] Try IDA*, GBFS, and eGBFS - Suren
- [x] Set up aggression Experiments - 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 - Suren - Nov 25



- [ ] Set up visualization of all the experiments - Suren
